# GTAMultiTool
A MultiTool For Modder Use

This Tool Is Used Mainly For Uninstalling A Few Menus,
Downloading Scripts For 2Take1 Users,
Uninstalling Mods Like NVE,
and Fixing Game Crashes Related To Files

To Clear Up What The Other Files Are Doing,

- The _GTA_Fix.exe_ Is A Folder Selector As Certain Options Require The User To Select A Certain Directory
- The _temp.bat_ Hosts A Line Of Code The Batch Calls For When Using Certain Options
- And The Text File Simply Hosts ASCII Text For The GUI

Instructions:
1. Download As Zip And Keep All The Files Together As The Batch Will Break
If They Are Separated. 
2. Run The Batch, Not The Exe.
3. The GUI Is Made To Be User Friendly And Easy To Navigate But If You Have Any Issues, Contact itschrome#4043 on discord.
